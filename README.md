## Abort Browser Fingerprinting Scripts via uBlock Origin

### Features:
1. **[API protection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6946045/87235868-ff5c3d80-c395-11ea-87b1-56f759419043.png)**: canvas, audio, webgl, and clientRects
2. **Session Based**: randomization is stored in site session and resets only on a new session
3. **Detection**: fingerprinting behavior is detected in real time
4. **Permission**: script execution is paused and your permission is required to allow fingerprinting (per session)<sup>1</sup>
5. **Defensive**: api tampering is protected with a [proxy](https://adtechmadness.wordpress.com/2019/03/23/javascript-tampering-detection-and-stealth/) to prevent detection
6. **Genuine**: random output does not contain gibberish
7. **Minimal**: to avoid site breakage, APIs are not blocked and only a few are altered

<sup>1</sup> If cancel (abort) is selected, a random error will be thrown 1 or more times at the script as it attempts to finish fingerprinting. This may or may not abort the script. During the session, if the script URL was identified and later resurfaces, an error will be thrown at the script on every attempt it tries to read a high entropy property. This final blow should abort the script and render it useless. To avoid detection, the error randomization is reset only after a 30 second delay. Since scripts may yield different results, use this option with caution: [1] the error is intended to [break the script](https://www.nothingprivate.ml), [2] in the case of muliple sessions (cross site fingerprinting), the error may be [computed as random output](https://panopticlick.eff.org), [3] the error may be [properly handled](https://arkenfox.github.io/TZP/index.html), or [4] the collection of random errors may be traced per session and then used to fingerprint your browser and link your sessions.
